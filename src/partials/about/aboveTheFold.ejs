    Prior to founding GaP, Matt and Bret built Environmental Services, Waste Management, Analytical Testing, and 
    Soil/Groundwater Remediation companies from the ground up. They also acquired Environmental businesses and 
    personally sold those companies to Private Equity Buyers, Competitors, and Public Companies.
  </p>
  <p>
    The real-world experience Matt and Bret gained through ownership and eventual sale of Environmental Service 
    businesses means they’re the only transaction advisory out there that intimately knows your business.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having once walked in&thinsp;<mark class="red-text">YOUR</mark>&thinsp;shoes they know the challenges of marketing 
    and successfully selling environmental industry businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
    They spent decades dealing with RCRA, EPA, DOT, HAZWOPER, CERCLA, 40 CFR, Subtitle D, Manifesting, 
    Land Banned Materials, Recycling, Landfill, Incineration, Fuels Blending, Universal Waste, Asbestos, 
    Profiling for Characteristics, Lab Packs, E-Waste, Listed Waste, NORM, WWTS, Roll-offs, Vacuum Trucks, Air Movers, 
    Emergency Response, Tank Cleaning, Confined Space Entry, and UST’s, along with all the other unique aspects 
    environmental professionals encounter, means GaP is particularly qualified to understand and represent an 
    environmental business like&thinsp;<mark class="red-text">YOURS</mark>.
